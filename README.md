# Anime_Recommender_System
Since the csv files are very large I am attaching a gdrive link : ([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rsMSbe_1frNxMx-rtFFkLOaXqx2EJCVq?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IqjyhDD3dfrdp1Eua0yjPhTGKJgMIkLC/view?usp=drive_link))
Used libraries like nltk, numpy and pandas.
This system uses NLP concepts like bag of words to find the most similar animes.
It is a content-based recommendation system.
Used Streamlit to build the final app.
